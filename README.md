# CMSI 186 Lab 5 Pod Racing Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for the Pod Racing laboratory assignment. You will find some unfinished Java classes that you will need to complete. You will also have to add some new classes of your own.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/5/). Use the provided test scripts as you complete the laboratory assignment.

In your new repository, don’t forget to completely edit this README file, as _your_ repository will not contain any “unfinished Java programs.” Consider adding a fun image, but not _too_ fun, as your GitHub repository will be checked by prospective employers.



I created many racing pods in a simulation which operate at different speeds. I will assign each arguments that will make them run differently in the code. Some of them will accelerate very fast and then slow down, some while start slow and accelerate, and some may go really fast but suddenly stop working.
